0.9.7 Use inline style attributes rather than <style> in head.

0.9.6 Maximum z-index of the slides can now be set. Plugin default is 100
      which doesn't play real nice with the Elemental theme's responsive nav.
      Specifying a value of 80 works much better.

0.9.5 Removed button option since these will now hide if the
      button text is left blank or there is no link. Added
      option to fadein captions. Removed more deprecated code.

0.9.4 Remove absolute position of buttons on edit
      Drop any images that don't exist from getting to the view.

0.9.3 File handling pushed into controller, simplifying view.
      Replace deprecated functions

0.9.2 Fixed fatal error adding block to page

0.9.1 Button CSS classes may be edited but will default to "btn btn-default"
